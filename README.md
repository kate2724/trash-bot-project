# trash-bot-project
This trash collecting robot program cleans up rooms by autonomously identifying trash and moving it to a designated space. The program will search for a blue ball, grab it, then take it to "the dumpster" a red flag or sheet of paper, with a white sheet of paper on the ground in front of it. The robot will then repeat this process for an orange ball.
